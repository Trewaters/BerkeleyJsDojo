# The Berkeley JavaScript Dojo Code of Conduct

*(copied from [JSConf](https://jsconf.com/codeofconduct.html))*

All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any Berkeley JavaScrip Dojo (BJD) event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## The Quick Version
BJD is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Community participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community without a refund at the discretion of the community organisers.

## The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of community staff immediately. Community staff can be identified by a clearly marked "STAFF" shirt.

Community staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the community. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all community venues and community-related social events.
