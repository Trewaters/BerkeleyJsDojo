# Yatate

: notebook :: The Yatate is a folder of BJD members to create txt or md document named after their call-sign.

### Yatate contributions

The file name for the sifu's yatate file is `<SIFU-CALL-SIGN>.txt`. A yatate file can be in the format of `.txt` or `.md`. Please keep this file readable.

The **call-sign** is your sifu name, the name you want to go by in the dojo. This is just for fun. It can't be the same as someone else's call-sign/name and should be respectful of others. The Yatate file is full of contact information for you. Read the "Yatate-README.md"

In this document a sifu will put the following, unless noted as _OPTIONAL_. This is **public** so don't put phone numbers and other _personal_ information you wouldn't want shared with the world.

- **Name**: Real life name
- **Sifu Name / call-sign**: Name you would like to be called in the "Dojo" or by other Sifus.
- **Email**: public email anyone can contact them at.
- **Github**: profile web adress
- **Twitter**: (OPTIONAL) profile web address
- **LinkedIn**: (OPTIONAL) profile web address
- **StackOverflow**: (OPTIONAL) profile web address
- **Other web addresses**: (OPTIONAL) Any other web addresses a sifu thinks the Dojo and public should know about. These are things like a business, project, or portfolio.
- **BJD Belts**: a bulleted list of belts that the sifu has achieved. The format should be `<COLOR> belt,<DATE-COMPLETED>,<COMMENTS>`. Comments are things like what sifu monitored the progress and use their dojo name. The belt achievement is verified (reviewed) by the _Sifu Root_ and merged by _Sifu Root_ only.
- **Notes**: (OPTIONAL) Bio, or other miscellaneous information
