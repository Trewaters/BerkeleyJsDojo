:Fireworks::Trophy:: Congratulations on making it this far.

## White [0] - 0000
- Do any of the Kata positions for 30 days contiguously. Have public verifiable proof of your work. Mentors count.
1. Post your kata work in your Github repo.

## Yellow [1] - 0100
- Verify a white belts 30 day contiguous work as their mentor.
1. Check in with the "White belt" sifu. 
2. Post in their Github that you "checked in" on them. This allows a public verification.

- Mentor someone, or peer review another sifu. Peer review is necessary when there are not enough white belts to work with.
1. Post in their Github that you "checked in" on them.
2. Do this for 30 days.

## Orange [2] - 1000
- Build something... in part or entirely.
- ideas are web app, tutorial, ...

## Green [3] - 1100
- #100DaysOfCode Challenge
- Give a shout out to #BerkeleyJavaScriptDojo in your posts.

## Blue [4] - 0010
- Give back to the coding community and learn while you give.
- Contribute to open source projects.

## Purple [5] - 1010
- Work in a team.
- Find a group that needs your help and volunteer to assist them. Criteria are:
1. You become a responsible part of the group. This requires that you do more than just listen. Must accept some position of responsibility in the project team.
2. Get publicly verifiable proof that you contributed in some responsible way. PR's are a great way to show this.

## Brown [6] - 0110
- Start a project.
- Create a public Github repo with a project you are working on.
- Accept help on the project. If someone asks to be part of your Project you must find a way to incorporate them into your project. Even if they can't code you should be able to find what they are good at and help them do that task.

## Red [7] - 1001
- Get a programming job. You could be a developer, manager, or startup.
- "Get Bloody" by finding out how the software industry really works.

## Gray [8] - 0101
- Has followed all the steps outlined in achieving their previous belts.
- Asking how to be a black belt?
1. A gray belt is someone that is technically able but still needs enlightenment. As long as a gray belt is asking how to be a black belt they are not ready to be a black belt. Once they realize the only difference between them and the black belt is confidence they are ready to be a black belt.
2. It is okay to fail, or suffer setbacks, creating a dojo. They key is they are giving it their best effort.

## Black [9] - 1101
- Start your own dojo
