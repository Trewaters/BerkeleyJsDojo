### Bubble Sort
- [documented here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/bubble-sort/)
-Of the five types of sorting algorithms covered in this guide, Bubble sort is the simplest but 
also the most inefficient. Bubble sort swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order and
does so until an entire passthrough is completed without any swaps occuring.

### Selection Sort
- [documented here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/selection-sort)
-With this implementation of the selection sort method, you will need two for loops, the nested
loop will be used as a pointer to check for the lowest value in the array and the outer loop
will be used to shift the start of the next passthru by one.
These are the steps to follow:
1. Define a variable's value to the first index' element. This variable will be used to temporarily 
set the lowest value in the array. 
2. Check every cell in an array from left to right. That will be handled by the nested loop. As 
you iterate thru the array, check the value of each index. 
3. If the current index has a lower value than the current lowest set value, reassign your variable 
to be the value of the current index. 
4. Once you've iterated thru the array n times and completed the passthru, swap the value from 
the first index with the value of the last index that was set to be the lowest value in the array. 
5. The start of subsequent passthrus will shift incrementally by one. That will be the outer 
loop's function.

### Insertion Sort
- [documented here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/insertion-sort)
-In this implementation of the insertion sort method, a while loop is nested inside of a for
loop. There are three main operations that occur with this method: removal of value from index,
temporary storage of removed value, comparison between temporary value and values to the left
of the empty index, shifting all values greater than the temp value to the right, and inserting
the temporary value to the right of the index that holds a value greater than the temporary value.
1. Define a variable that represents the position of the position of the pointer to be value of the
for loop's initializer.
2. Define a variable that will temporarily store the value of the index the pointer is currently 
pointing at.
