### Bubble Sort
- [documented here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/bubble-sort/)
-Of the five types of sorting algorithms covered in this guide, Bubble sort is the simplest but 
also the most inefficient. Bubble sort swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order and
does so until an entire passthrough is completed without any swaps occuring.

### Selection Sort
