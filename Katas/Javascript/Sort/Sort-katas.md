### Bubble Sort
- [documented here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/bubble-sort/)
-Of the five types of sorting algorithms covered in this guide, Bubble sort is the simplest but 
also the most inefficient. Bubble sort swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order and
does so until an entire passthrough is completed without any swaps occuring.

### Selection Sort
- [documented here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/algorithms/sorting-algorithms/selection-sort)
-With this implementation of the selection sort method, you will need two for loops, the nested
loop will be used as a pointer to check for the lowest value in the array and the outer loop
will be used to shift the start of the next passthru by one.
These are the steps to follow:
Define a variable's value to the first index' element. This variable will be used to temporarily 
set the lowest value in the array. Check every cell in an array from left to right. That will be 
handled by the nested loop. As you iterate thru the array, check the value of each index. If the 
current index has a lower value than the current lowest set value, reassign your variable to be 
the value of the current index. Once you've iterated thru the array n times and completed the 
passthru, swap the value from the first index with the value of the last index that was set to be 
the lowest value in the array. The start of subsequent passthrus will shift incrementally by one. 
That will be the outer loop's function.
