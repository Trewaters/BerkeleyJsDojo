# Katas ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata )

: notebook :: Exercises that help sifus deepen their programming knowledge.

### Kata contributions

- `<STYLE>-katas.md` - the intent of katas is to be have no code. Only a description of what the sifu should do.
  - All katas are labeled as `### Position <NUMBER>: <TITLE-OF-KATA>`.
  - Title is followed by a bulleted description of what the sifu should do. I like step by step but paragraph format is acceptable also.
  - Katas are added at the bottom of each file and numbered sequentially. This sets up a chronology and makes it easier to reference for sifus in the future.
- `<STYLE>-guide.md` - the intent of the guide is to help sifus learn. There are multiple ways to solve any programming challenge. The guide shows one way to solve the kata in detail.
  - The guide is the place to outline all the details for accomplishing a kata "position".
  - List steps in bullets so they are easy to follow.
  - use back ticks to highlight code like so `code to do something`
  - or you can use multiple backticks to highlight sections of code like so
  ```javascript
  /// do some code here
  ```
  - Top of the guide has general <STYLE> commands and patterns.
  - Bottom of a style guide where a sifu will add new _Position_ guides with the corresponding code.
