Welcome to the Berkeley Javascript Dojo GitHub repo. This `README.md` is important. We provide you with the basic structure of the repo in the Table of Contents. Each section listed in the table of contents has instructions on what and how to contribute to that section. The sections are folders in the repo.

# `Javascript Dojo Philosophy`
Berkeley Javascript Dojo is the first of hopefully many coding dojos. The primary principle of this coding dojo is work. Everyone must work for the knowledge and skills they wish to attain. The second principle is sharing. Once a Sifu (practitioner) has learned something they are willing to share it with other Sifus that ask.

In order to help others I have created a github repo. The repo contains different folders over topics that anyone can access and use. I have structured this repo as outlined in this readme file.

The goal is to give Sifus practical tools to expand their knowledge base and skill sets. If a Sifu uses this Repo they should find something to test them and teach them.

# Katas
Patterns that help you deepen your programming knowledge. Katas are broken into a few categories by framework.
- Angular - the file in the folder doesn't have 2 lines of information. Not even really started.
- GitHub - I have spent the most work on this set of katas.
- MongoDB - empty at the moment.
- Node - I started on this but it is a mess at the moment. This is before I got a structure to the idea of katas.

# Koans
Programming riddles to ponder. Expand your perspective and hopefully become enlightened.

# Notes
Various notes that might help others. Related to meetup topics we have had in the past. Think of it like the meeting minutes.

# Projects
Sub folder of code that the group has worked on together. Projects in this section have a project lead and were voted in by a quorum. See the GitHub Issues, Projects and Wiki section for more detail on the project you are interested in.

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Trewaters/BerkeleyJsDojo/issues)
(TO DO: Link to GitHub issues page) All issues related to a project have labels with the project name in them. This will make the project related issues easier to search.

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Trewaters/BerkeleyJsDojo/projects)
(TO DO: Link to GitHub projects page) 

[GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Trewaters/BerkeleyJsDojo/wiki)
(TO DO: Link to GitHub links page) The project lead has created a wiki for the project with the following format.

# Wuxia
Javascript Wuxia are things you will need to do in any language. Wuxia is split into Front End Task, Server Side Task, Database, and Mobile Apps.

# Yatate
The Yatate is a folder of BJD members to create txt or md document named after their call-sign. In this document they will put the following.
- Name: Real life name
- Email: public email anyone can contact them at.
- Github: profile web adress
- Twitter: profile web address
- LinkedIn: profile web address
- StackOverflow: profile web address
- Other web addresses: Any other web addresses they think the Dojo and public should know about like business, projects, or portfolio's
- Notes or other miscellanious information.

# To Do
- The Github Kata folder is the most developed kata I have right now. Most of the other folders are empty and incomplete.
